### The repository for the project is available at https://github.com/frediff/miniRISC

## miniRISC 

Our processor miniRISC has the following Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The processor has a 32 bit word, with all the registers and memory elements having 32 bit data. We develop first the op-code format for the above instruction set, identify the data path element and design the data path along with the control signals. Subsequently, we develop a single-cycle instruction execution unit for miniRISC.
